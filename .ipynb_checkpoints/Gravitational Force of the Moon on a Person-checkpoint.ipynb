    "The gravitational pull of the moon on Earth's oceans create the tides. The moon pulls the water on the near side of the Earth toward it, creating a bulge. The Earth is also pulled toward the moon, leaving another bulge on the far side. This creates two high tides on either side of the Earth. As the Earht rotates through these bulges, the land above the water exeperiences two high tides and two low tides every day."

    "The questions at hand is whether the water in the human body experiences the same gravitational tug as the oceans, giving us reason to believe that the moon could have a gravitational effect on the human body. To answer this question, let's first remind ourselves of Newton's Law of Gravitational Attraction:\n",

    "The gravitational force between two masses is found by multiplying their masses, dividing by the square of the distance between them, and multiplying again by the gravitational constant $G$. Let's calculate the amount of force between the moon and the ocean's of the earth. As a point of comparison, we can compare that to the weight of the Empire State Building, a fairly large skyscrapper in New York City."

This is all but certainly too small to impose any measurable effect on the human body's biological or chemical processes. One should also note that inside of the body, the small mass of atoms, molecules, and even cells makes them far less sensitive to the gravitational force than they are to the electromagnetic force. This manifests as the attraction or repelling of charged surfaces, and the bonds of polar atoms, among other phenomenon.\n",
